:: ========================================================================
:: 
:: Specify the location of the anaconda installation on portable harddrive
:: leaving off the drivename. 
:: 
:: So if you installed it to a usb drive folder called
::     F:\Anaconda
:: You would change the line below to
::     SET anaconda_folderpath="\Anaconda"
:: 
:: NOTE: 
::       If the drivename includes spaces, make sure the folderpath 
::       is surrounded by double quotes. But as this isn't tested too thorougly
::       it is recommended you not use file/folder/path names with spaces.
:: NOTE: 
::       Do not put a space on either side of the equals sign below


:: !!!!!!!!!!!!!! You should change the line below this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

SET anaconda_folderpath="\Anaconda with spaces"
